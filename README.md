    UPI deposit, such as the wrong VPA or bank account number, the funds
    will not be credited to your account.

    bank account to cover the deposit amount, the transaction will fail.
-   **Server issues:** The National Payments Corporation of India
    (NPCI), which processes UPI transactions, may occasionally
    experience server issues that can delay or prevent deposits from
    being processed.
